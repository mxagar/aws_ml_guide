# AWS Machine Learning Guide

This is a practical guide on how to deploy ML models in AWS using SageMaker. The file is structured following the Udemy course [AWS SageMaker Practical for Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-aws-sagemaker-6-real-world-case-studies/) by Dr. Ryan Ahmed.

It is a project-based course, consisting of the following sections:

1. Introduction, Success Tips, & Best Practices
2. Introduction to AI/ML, AWS and Cloud Computing
3. Project 1: Employee Salary Predictions Using AWS SageMaker Linear Learner
4. Project 2: Medical Insurance Premium Prediction
5. Project 3: Retail Sales Prediction Using AWS SageMaker XGBoost (Regression)
6. Project 4: Predict Cardiovascular Disease Using PCA & XGBoost (Classification)
7. Project 5: Deep Learning for Traffic Sign Classification Using AWS SageMaker
8. Project 6: SageMaker Studio DeepDive and AutoML

I would have forked the repository of the course material, but I have found only a download link which delivers the presentations, the notebooks and the required datasets. All that material can be found in `./udemy_aws`, but the folder is not committed.
